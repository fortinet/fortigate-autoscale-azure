# FortiGate Autoscale for Azure

An implementation of FortiGate Autoscale for the Microsoft Azure platform API with a Cosmos DB storage backend.

This project contains the code and templates for the **Microsoft Azure** deployment. For deployment on other cloud platforms, visit the relevant repository:

* The **AliCloud** deployment is in the  [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
* The **Amazon AWS** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-aws](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws) repository.
* The **GCP** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-gcp](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-gcp) repository.

This project has the following features:

1. Multi-group Hybrid Licensing models:
    * **BYOL-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Autoscale group of (0 or more) Bring Your Own License (BYOL) FortiGate instances.
    * **PAYG-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Autoscale group of (0 or more) on-demand FortiGate instances.
    * **Hybrid**: 1 fix-sized Autoscale group of 2 (or more) BYOL FortiGate instances, and 1 dynamically scalable Autoscale group of (0 or more) on-demand FortiGate instances.
2. FortiAnalyzer integration.

[autoscale-core](https://github.com/fortinet/autoscale-core) contains the core logic and provides an interface that can be extended to deal with the differences in cloud platform APIs.
